# Running Training Plan MIP (CSCI 358 Final Project)

To run please use
```console
$ python3 run.py
```

This creates a random instance that the LP is designed to solve. Furthermore, doubles are currently turned off and rest days set to 1 due to computational cost. They were working previously (see plan.out) but suddenly stopped for some unknown reason (it became unclear as to how long it would take to complete). It freezes at x% during linear optimization.

plan1-9.lp contain a sample 315-day plan.
