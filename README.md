# Running Training Plan MIP (CSCI 358 Final Project)

To run please use
```console
$ python3 run.py
```

This creates a random instance that the LP is designed to solve. Furthermore, doubles are currently turned off and rest days set to 1 due to computational cost. They were working previously (see plan.out) but suddenly stopped for some unknown reason. It freezes at x% during linear optimization.

plan1-9.lp contain a sample 315-day plan.
